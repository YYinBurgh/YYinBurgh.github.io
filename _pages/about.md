I'm an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/cems/cs" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/" target="_blank">University of Vermont (UVM)</a>. Before joining UVM, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a> and earned my PhD degree from the <a href="http://drexel.edu/cci/" target="_blank"> College of Computing &amp; Informatics </a> at <a href="http://drexel.edu/" target="_blank">Drexel University</a>.

My [Research](/research/) is at the intersection of **human-computer interaction (HCI), usable security &amp; privacy, trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI), and health informatics**. I investigate technical, societal, and interdisciplinary research questions towards building **an ideal future where computing technologies can leverage people's personal data in appropriate, ethical, and meaningful ways**.

<!-----We present a survey study of informational norms related to sharing of vaccination certificate information in different contexts such as education, health, and transportation. Beyond the blunt approach that privacy must be traded off against public health, our findings open the door to more informed and nuanced alternatives that allow the pursuit of public health even as we reinforce appropriate information practices. --->
