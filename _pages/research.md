I am a human-centered computing researcher, with strong interdisciplinary expertise in **human-computer interaction (HCI), usable privacy &amp; security, privacy-enhancing technologies, health informatics, ubiquitous computing, and applied machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI)**. 
I investigate both social and technical research topics to ensure the use of people’s personal information/data is appropriate, fair, and meaningful, particularly by emerging computing and information technologies. 

Specifically, I examine how emerging computing and information technologies impact people's personal information (e.g., the Internet of Things, wearable health trackers), from which I identify underlying socio-technical challenges related to people’s personal information (e.g., data privacy transparency, personal privacy management, ethics around ML/AI-enabled systems). Built on my research findings, I also design and develop proof-of-concept systems to address these challenges (e.g., [IoTA Assistant app](https://www.iotprivacy.io/discovering-iot), [IoT Portal](https://www.iotprivacy.io), [Opt-Out Easy](https://optouteasy.isr.cmu.edu)). The ultimate goal of my research is to improve people’s personal wellbeing and to achieve greater social good through computing and information technologies.
