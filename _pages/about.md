I'm an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/cems/cs" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/" target="_blank">University of Vermont (UVM)</a>. Before coming to UVM, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a> and earned my PhD degree from the <a href="http://drexel.edu/cci/" target="_blank"> College of Computing &amp; Informatics </a> at <a href="http://drexel.edu/" target="_blank">Drexel University</a>.

My research is at the intersection of **human-computer interaction (HCI), usable privacy &amp; security, privacy-enhancing technologies, health informatics, ubiquitous computing, and applied machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI)**. Overall, I investigate both social and technical research topics **to ensure the use of people’s personal information/data is appropriate, fair, and meaningful**. See my [Research](/research/) page for more details.

<!-----We present a survey study of informational norms related to sharing of vaccination certificate information in different contexts such as education, health, and transportation. Beyond the blunt approach that privacy must be traded off against public health, our findings open the door to more informed and nuanced alternatives that allow the pursuit of public health even as we reinforce appropriate information practices. --->
