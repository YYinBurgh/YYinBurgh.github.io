I am a human-centered computing researcher, with strong interdisciplinary expertise in **human-computer interaction (HCI), usable privacy &amp; security, Internet of Things (IoT) privacy, health informatics, and trustworthy & inclusive artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)**. 
My research aims to build an ideal future **where computing technologies can leverage people’s personal data in appropriate, ethical, and meaningful ways**.
Specifically, I examine how emerging computing technologies impact people's personal information (e.g., the Internet of Things, wearable health trackers), from which I identify underlying socio-technical challenges related to people’s personal information (e.g., data privacy transparency, personal privacy management, ethics around ML/AI-enabled systems). Built on my research findings, I also design and develop proof-of-concept systems to address these challenges (e.g., [IoTA Assistant app](https://www.iotprivacy.io/discovering-iot), [IoT Portal](https://www.iotprivacy.io), [Opt-Out Easy](https://optouteasy.isr.cmu.edu)).
