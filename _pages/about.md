I'm an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/cems/cs" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/" target="_blank">University of Vermont (UVM)</a>. Before joining UVM, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a> and earned my PhD degree from the <a href="http://drexel.edu/cci/" target="_blank"> College of Computing &amp; Informatics </a> at <a href="http://drexel.edu/" target="_blank">Drexel University</a>.

My [Research](/research/) is at the intersection of **human-computer interaction (HCI), usable security &amp; privacy, responsible artificial intelligence (AI), and health informatics**. I investigate technical, societal, and interdisciplinary research questions towards building **an ideal future where computing technologies can leverage people's personal data in appropriate, ethical, and meaningful ways**.
